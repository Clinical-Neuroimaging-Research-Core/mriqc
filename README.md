# mriqc

[mriqc](https://github.com/nipreps/mriqc), developed by the Poldrack Lab at Stanford University, is a software tool that extracts quality measures and performs quality assessments on structural (T1,T2) and functional MRI.

It is built on toolboxes such as FSL, ANTs and AFNI, and utilizes python toolboxes such as nipype.

mriqc is BIDS-compatible and can easily be integrated with other pipelines (such as fMRIprep)

Similiarly to heudiconv and fMRIprep, mriqc is best used as a container - either via Docker or Singularity.

For more information on mriqc, look through the mriqc [website](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [github](https://github.com/nipreps/mriqc)
